        <h2>The GameStop That Was</h2>
        <p>The GameStop on 84th street was my go-to video game store. It was massive. The gray shelves were always packed sky-high with all sorts of video games from all different platforms, with all the green Xbox games, blue PlayStation games, and red Nintendo games being the highlight. However, my favorite section was always the used Wii games section. Those aging, abandoned games were dirt cheap, usually under five dollars and sometimes as low as one dollar. I loved those games, and I own a Wii, so this was a dream come true. If the games weren’t hot garbage, that is.</p>
        <p>It was easy to get lost in that store. All the shelves, the TVs, it was always a magical experience. Whether I was looking in the front area, or the back area, even if I wasn’t looking, it was always exciting to just be there.</p>
        <p>GameStop was fun, but it was always more fun with other people. I would often bring my brother and friends, and we would go together. I remember one time during Black Friday, I wanted to buy the Nintendo Switch. I didn’t have one yet, but there was this one Black Friday bundle that came with a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for free with the Nintendo Switch. 
        Moreover, GameStop had a deal where with every purchase of a Nintendo Switch, they would give out a free fifty-dollar GameStop gift card. At first, my dad and I tried to buy it online, but it was sold out there, so he called GameStop, and as it turned out, they were in stock at the store. I got ready, and we went to GameStop. Because it was Black Friday, we even took a taxi to get there faster, but the line was still almost out the door.
        I waited for what felt like forever, eagerly waiting for my chance to buy the Nintendo Switch. My dad, meanwhile, was chatting with the guy in front of us who was there with his daughter to also buy a Nintendo Switch. Once we were close, they announced that the Nintendo Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle was sold out. When the group in front of us gets to order, they mention the Nintendo Switch bundle, and the guy at the register revealed that he had found five more Nintendo Switch Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundles in the back.
        Hearing that was the best thing that could have happened. I could hardly believe my luck. My dad made this happen since it was his idea to take the taxi. Without him, I wouldn’t have gotten the Nintendo Switch.</p>
        <p>Another story I have takes place a little after that. It’s summer, and my brother Sammy, my friend Oscar, and I decided to go to GameStop with the fifty-dollar gift card. I’ve known Oscar since first grade, and I always have a good time with him. I still hadn’t used it, so I thought that would be a good time. We went and had our own little shopping spree. My brother and I picked out Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 on the Nintendo Switch and a Batman game, and my friend tried to get Far Cry on the Wii, but the cashier wouldn’t let him because he wasn’t old enough. After that, we went back to my house to play the games we got.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I can’t do that anymore because that GameStop closed down about a year or two ago. All of those escapes into new worlds, getting lost in the games, going out with friends and family, that’s all gone now. I can’t experience those shopping sprees or Black Friday lines there anymore. That’s all in the past, but that’s just the way it is. New York is constantly changing, with buildings and stores appearing and disappearing. But it doesn’t hurt any less. Now I’m back in the real world, living in reality once again, forced to find other ways to escape.</p>
